Tech Stack

Java : Java is a widely-used, platform-independent, object-oriented programming language.

Hibernate : Hibernate is an open-source object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for Java. It simplifies database operations in Java applications by allowing you to work with Java objects instead of writing native SQL queries. Hibernate maps Java classes to database tables and provides an efficient way to interact with databases.

Java Swing : Java Swing is a set of graphical user interface (GUI) components for building desktop applications in Java.

MySQL : MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). It is widely used for data storage and retrieval in various Java applications. You can connect Java applications to MySQL databases using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity).

RMI (Remote Method Invocation) : RMI is a Java API for remote communication between different Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) in a network. It allows objects to invoke methods on objects residing in remote JVMs, making it a mechanism for distributed computing. RMI is often used to build distributed and client-server applications.
